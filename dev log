making a game! Learning canvas skills.
started dev log way too far in sorry

12/14 - moving movement into a function
end - started by taking values on call from wsad, realized i want a recursive funtion, tried making a recursive function, did not figure out how to wait 5 secs...

12/15 - goal 1 - fix bug where square wont move in seperate function 
SOLUITION : use == instead of =
goal 2 - fluid animation 
SOLUTION: Key up event listener
goal 3 - fix bug where point doesn't get detected or respawned but still gets deleted 
SOLUTION: move spawnpoint call into offscreen function
goal 4 - reset on off screen
SOLUTION: redefine all vars then call offscreen again
